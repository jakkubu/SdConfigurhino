SdConfigurhino
==============

Load your settings to Arduino via config.txt file stored on SD-card. Very convenient way to control your Arduino projects.

This project was developed on the basis on [ArduinoSettings](https://github.com/JurgenG/ArduinoSettings). Many thanks to [Jurgen](https://github.com/JurgenG)
